        <h1>The art Of Interior Designing</h1>
        <p>Art brings a home’s character and personality to life. Working with colors, textures and patterns, 
            interior designers create different moods and styles for a home. Bringing in the work of artists,
            they can combine multiple elements to highlight and accentuate a client’s personal taste in their
            daily life. At the same time, designers can show their clients how the right pieces will work together
            with furniture, fixtures and room decor.<br>
            While designers look for art when laying out a room or house, they may not have the opportunity to 
            work directly with an artist or curate a client’s collection. Art is selected that 
            supports new talent and young brands, in addition to working with established artists. At the same time,
            we welcome the opportunity to curate art around the style or mood of a home. The following ideas are 
            a few things to consider when selecting art, each an exploration into selecting the right piece for 
            your style. The <a href="https://thechelseaproject.org/">Chelsea Project</a> incorporates the owner’s existing art and collectibles.
